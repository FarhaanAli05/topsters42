# Topsters 4

Made with `React`, `NextJS`, `TypeScript`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

Based on [Topsters 3](https://topsters.org/) . There are some few extra features that I wanted to have, and that's why I implemented my own version :)

Topsters 1 and 2 are not around anymore, but Topsters
3 is still up and running and has been for a couple or
years already. Give it a try if you want!

Also, if you feel like you can improve upon this
version and pass on the legacy, you can fork the
GitHub repo or go ahead and make your own Topsters 5
from scratch!
