# Topsters 4

Made with `React`, `NextJS`, `TypeScript`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

Based on [Topsters 3](https://topsters.org/) . There are some few extra features that I wanted to have, and that's why I implemented my own version :)

It only has support for games, unlike Topsters 3, where you can also add music, TV shows, movies, books and pretty much anything you like. I know the concept was originally in fact for music but gaming is my thing. Maybe I'll add support someday... sorry!

Topsters 1 and 2 are not around anymore, but Topsters
3 is still up and running and has been for a couple or
years already. Give it a try if you want!

Also, if you feel like you can improve upon this
version and pass on the legacy, you can fork the
GitHub repo or go ahead and make your own Topsters 5
from scratch!
